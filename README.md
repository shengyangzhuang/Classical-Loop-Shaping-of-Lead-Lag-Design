# Classical-Loop-Shaping-of-Lead-Lag-Design

Loop-shaping is a classical procedure for designing feedback controllers in the frequency domain. In the basic course it was called lead lag design. Loop-shaping was introduced in the 1930s and was used to construct single variable circuits, such as feedback amplifiers (Bode). The approach is generally applicable to linear single-input-single-output (SISO) feedback systems and has also been extended to multivariable systems, i.e., systems with multiple input and output signals (MIMO). 

The basic idea in loop-shaping is to shape the open-loop gain with a controller in order to achieve intended properties of the closed-loop system under feedback. In the 70s and 80s advanced methods for loop-shaping based on optimization were developed. However, in this computer exercise we will focus on classical ”manual” loop-shaping.

We will here only consider SISO systems, but the ideas are also applicable to MIMO systems as we will see later in the course.
